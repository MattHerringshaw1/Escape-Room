                            <p>Eddie currently resides in Atlanta, GA. When he's not creating a fun and nifty piece of code, Eddie likes to spend his time with his wife Sam, his amazing son Leo, and his fluffy cat Alex. As a former theatre educator, Eddie is, for the most part, a silly individual.</p>

                            <p>Matt currently lives in West Texas, but was born in Upstate NY;  needless to say he has a profound admiration for nature and the beauty surrounding it. He is just starting his coding career and always looking for new places to practice his skill. You can often find him coding outside at the park with his dogs or at the lake on a nice summers day.</p>
